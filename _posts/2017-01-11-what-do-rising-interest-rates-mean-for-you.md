In case you haven’t heard yet, the Federal Reserve met recently and decided to raise interest rates. This is the second time they have raised them since 2006, when the economy was yet to be hit by the economic crisis.

The move was widely expected, as a falling unemployment rate and rising wages signaled that the market and overall price increases would soon meet and potentially surpass the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2% per year. What does that mean for the real estate market?

If you’re buying a home, chances are you will opt for a 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Most buyers do. These loans have become more affordable since the financial crisis. Rates bottomed out at 3.5%.

In general, the movement of the Fed’s rate does not have a large direct impact on long-term rates. However, when the Fed’s rate does go up, the banks always find ways to pass their higher borrowing costs along to the consumers. Because long-term mortgage rates are set in stone, they factor in the anticipation of future rate increases as well.

The Federal Reserve has suggested that interest rates will likely continue to rise. As rates go up, people are less likely to buy a house. Those with fixed rates are also less likely to refinance.

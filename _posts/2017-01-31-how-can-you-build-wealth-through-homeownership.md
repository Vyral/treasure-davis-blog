If you’ve made the transition from renter to homeowner, you’ll want to learn how you can grow your wealth using your home.

One of the major benefits to owning a home is getting to build your wealth, and there are a few ways to go about doing it.

The first is through long-term homeownership. If you’ve owned your home for awhile, especially if put a mortgage on it, over time you start paying off the principle rather than interest. This builds long-term wealth into your property.

Homeownership also lets your claim certain tax deductions, which are not available to you as a renter. You can write off property taxes and the interest that you pay each month.

You can also take out a home equity line of credit. It’s possible to use that instead of credit cards to refinance your car or student loans and write off interest from those.

Also, over time, if you’re a single person and you have lived in your home as your primary residence for at least two years, you have the potential to realize a profit of up to $250,000 without paying taxes thanks to capital gains. If you’re married, that number doubles to $500,000.

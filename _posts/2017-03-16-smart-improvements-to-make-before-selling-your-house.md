Depending on the age and style of your home, there is a long list of improvements you could and should make before listing your home in order to get the maximum return on your investment.

**Here are just a few suggestions we have if you’re thinking of selling your house soon:**

* Get rid of wallpaper
* Change out-of-date fixtures
* Repaint any bold colors with more neutral, gray tones
* Make sure carpets are cleaned, replace them if needed
* Clean or refinish hardwood floors if needed
* Replace any chipped or peeling paint
* Place a colorful doormat on your front porch

We are in an area where buyers are heavily financed by VA and FHA loans. **Accomplishing the list of tasks above gives you a much better shot at ensuring your home passes the appraisal**when the time comes.

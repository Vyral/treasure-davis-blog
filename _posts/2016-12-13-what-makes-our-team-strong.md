We wanted to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about why we think we work stronger as a team than we do individually. We decided to work as a team because together, we are able to offer better service to our clients.

Sales partner Taryn Simental has been with us for two years and focuses on making the home buying process easy and stress-free for first-time home buyers and families moving from out of state.

Business partner Leighanne Potts focuses on client relationships with the team and makes sure our clients are confident and comfortable throughout the process. We love the personal relationships that we develop with our clients.

Angela Clark is a listing coordinator who helps you get all the way through to the contract stage of the process.

Aeriel Barr is part of the transaction coordination team here. Once a deal goes under contract, this part of our team helps make sure it's a seamless process from start to finish for both buyers and sellers.

Dean Jaeger is a sales partner and he helps clients with purchasing their homes and developing relationships. He's there to answer any questions before, during, and after the process. He constantly aims to keep a good relationship with our clients.

Jed Johnson is our newest team member and he's a sales partner. He really likes working with investors, but he specializes in working with any home buyer.

Aaron Davis focuses on the listing side as a business manager. He's in charge of signs and lock boxes in addition to meeting with appraisers.

Our transaction coordinator, Liz Rothring, and our marketing coordinator, Victoria Morak weren't able to join us for this exercise, but they are definitely vital parts of our team and our success.

As a team, we believe we're powerful and able to make sure you have the best service possible. We want to help you find the right home and make sure the process goes smoothly for you along the way.

If you have any questions for our team or you're thinking of buying or selling a home in Colorado Springs, we'd love to serve you. Just give us a call or send us an email!
